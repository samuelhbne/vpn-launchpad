## What if 'vlp build' command stalled with no response

You can stop 'vlp build' with Ctl+C if it stalls more than 5 minutes waiting for the response from AWS command centre. Then run "vlp purge" to purge the possible partially created VPN server and try 'vlp build' again.

## What if Local proxy stops working after I rebuilt VPN server

VPN server IP address may changed after rebuilding. Running "lproxy build" again will remove the current running proxy container from Pi box and start a new proxy with updated server settings.

## Can I build multiple VPN servers with the same AWS account

Yes. But they must be located in different regions. For example: one in ap-northeast-1 and one in ap-northeast-2. Another words: one server in a region.

## Can I create an instance other than t2.micro for saving money

Yes. Modify the settings in $VLPHOME/vlp.env please.

```bash
$ cat vlp.env
UBUNTUVER="bionic"
STACKID="vlp-$UBUNTUVER"
PROFILE="default"
INSTYPE="t4g.micro"
INSTARCH="arm64"
```

### NOTE1

Currently server-softether support only X86_64 platform due to the upstream limitation. This could chang in the future.

## Can I share VPN server with multiple Pi boxes located in different sites

Yes. 'vlp build' saves server connection parameters in VPN serever instance matadata. Hence all vpn-launchpad boxes configured with same AWS account and same region automaticly share the same VPN server instance.

- Initialise box1 via 'vlp init' with your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
- Build VPN server on box1 with 'vlp build'
- Build local proxy on box1 with 'lproxy build'
- Initialise box2 via 'vlp init' with the same Access Key ID and Secret Access Key used by box1
- Build local proxy on box2 with 'lproxy build'
- Done.
